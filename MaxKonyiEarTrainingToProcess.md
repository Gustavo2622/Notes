Progress checks:
1. Can you recognize the tonic?
2. Produce the tonic? 
  1. Given a drone
  2. Given a piece of music
3. Can you recognize each degree of the major scale?
  1. In isolation, over a drone
4. Transcribe simple melodies by ear (nursery rhymes e.g.) over a drone
5. Transcribe melodies by singing them after hearing (in real music) without touching the instrument
6. Transcribe in real time without checking

Extra tips:
Go on a walk, drone on the headphones and sing
Feel the different resonances and experiment
Try to feel scales and stuff

Chords?
Intervals?
