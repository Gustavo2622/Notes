# The [[Real Numbers]] are Uncountable

There is no [[Bijective Function]] between any [[Countable Set]], or, equivalently, the [[Natural Numbers]] and the [[Real Numbers]]. 

# Motivation

When studying the [[Natural Numbers]] and [[Number Sequences]] we are fairly naturally let to the question of whether every set is completely enumerable in a sequence. This theorem comes to assert the contrary, that there exist sets that cannot be fully contained by *any* sequence. 

This theorem is a beginning into [[Cardinal Theory]], the study of the sizes of infinities, because it shows that there are different sizes of infinities, rather than just one uniform [[Infinity]].
# Example Applications

## [[Uncountable Subsets of the Real Numbers have Unbounded Finite Subset Sums]]

In any uncountable subset of $\mathbb{R}$, for fixed bound $N$ we can always find a finite subset $S$ such that the sum of the elements of $S$ is greater than $N$. 

The intuition is that uncountable subsets mess with convergence, because we need a "jump" in cardinality to get to uncountability. Formally, this intuition comes from the theorem asserting that [[Countable Union of Countable Sets is Countable]].

A simple corollary of this result is that any subset $S$ of $\mathbb{R}$ that is such that any of its finite subsets has sum less than 2 (either sum of absolute values or absolute value of sum, second is a weaker condition), is necessarily a [[Countable Set]] or [[Finite Set]]. 

This can be proven directly by seeing that any number greater or equal than 2 in absolute value cannot be in the set and partitioning the interval $[-2, 2]$ into the intervals $[\frac{1}{n+1}, \frac{1}{n}]$, their symmetrics and the set $\{0\}$ and seeing that at least one of these sets must have infinite elements of $S$, since otherwise $S$ would be the union of its intersection with these sets and thus countable by the above cited result.
# Proof

The main proofs of this result rely on showing the impossibility of having a surjective function between the [[Natural Numbers]] and the [[Real Numbers]]. 

Therefore, we proceed by contradiction. Suppose there exists such a function:
$$
f:\mathbb{N} \twoheadrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$
## Cantor's Diagonal Argument

This is the original argument, and it relies on the [[Decimal Expansion of a Real Number]], namely that it is unique except in the case where we have an infinite sequence of trailing 0s or 9s. We can proceed by fixing one of these representations for each relevant number or we can consider the set of infinite sequences of digits between 0 and 9 quotiented by the equivalence relation generated by the preimages of the function taking $(a_n)_n$ to $\sum_n a_n * 10^{-n}$. 

Assuming therefore the approapriate treatment of the non-uniqueness, define the following infinite matrix: $a_{ij} = f(i)_j$ which is the $j$-th digit of $f(n)$. From this we will define a real number which is not in the image of $f$. The decimal expansion of this number will be given by:

$$
b_n = \begin{cases} 
	a_{nn} & if\ a_{nn} \neq 3 \\
	2 & if\ a_{nn} = 3
\end{cases}
$$
(of note that any numbers work in place of 2 and 3, as long as they are distinct from eachother and neither is 0 nor 9).
Since the number given by $b_n$ is different from each number in the image of $f$ in at least one position of the decimal expansion and the difference in expansions is preserved by the projection of the sequences into the real numbers (since it is not a change from trailing 9s to 0s or vice versa) we have reached a contradiction with the surjectiveness of f.

## [[Nested Closed Interval Property]]

This variant of the proof is based on the [[Nested Closed Interval Property]] or the [[Real Numbers]]. This property asserts that given a sequence of nested closed intervals (which are always non-empty), their intersection is non-empty.

We proceed by contradiction by assuming $f$ to be surjective.
Define a sequence of nested closed intervals by:
- $I_0 = [-\infty, +\infty]$  
- $I_{n+1} \subset I_n$ and $f(n) \notin I_{n+1}$ 
It is clear that we can choose such a sequence whatever the values of $f(n)$ happen to be. To make this fully clear, let $I_n = [a_n,b_n]$.
Then:
$$
I_{n+1} = \begin{cases} 
	I_{n+1} = I_n & f(n) \notin I_n \\
	[\frac{a_n + b_n}{2}, b_n] & f(n) = a_n \\
	[a_n, \frac{a_n + b_n}{2}] & f(n) = b_n \\
	[a_n, \frac{a_n + f(n)}{2}] & otherwise
\end{cases}
$$
(where we could also have defined the last case as $[\frac{b_n + f(n)}{2}, b_n]$).
This is a nested sequence of closed intervals, and so $\bigcap^{\infty}_i I_i = I \neq \emptyset$. But we also have that $f(\mathbb{N}) \cap I = \emptyset$ which is a contradiction, since we supposed that $f$ was surjective.
