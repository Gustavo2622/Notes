# [[Mental Models]] become Mental Tools

Having different mental models for the same thing/concept is useful. 
However, a model only becomes a tool when it is ingrained enough in our minds as to feel native. If you have to think about how to use the model in a particular situation, it is not yet a tool.

As a model gets used more and more in different situations and its use becomes more ingrained, it eventually becomes part of our thinking framework and of our [[Unconscious Expertise]].
