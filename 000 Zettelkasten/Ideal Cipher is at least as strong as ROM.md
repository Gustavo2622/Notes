# Ideal Cipher is at least as strong as ROM

The [[Ideal Cipher]] model is at least as strong as the [[Random Oracle]] Model since there is an [[Indifferentiable Construction of Cryptographic Primitives | indifferentiable construction]] of a random oracle from an ideal cipher.

This construction is based on the [[Merkle-Damgard Construction]] and is exemplified in the following diagram:
