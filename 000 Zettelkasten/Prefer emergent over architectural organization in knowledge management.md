# Prefer emergent over architectural organization in knowledge management

The general method of [[Zettelkasten]] organization is to let the structure emerge from the content rather than laying out the structure first and then filling in the content.

This lends itself far better for knowledge work since the connections are generally far less apparent and obvious than the knowledge and facts themselves. 

In fact, Luhmann argues that: 
> In comparison with this structure, which offers possibilities of connection that can be actualized, the importance of what has actually been noted is secondary.

For this reason, [[Notes should be densely linked]]. 

And since [[Backlinks can be used to implicitly define nodes in Knowledge Management Systems]], we can move fast and build the structure before having to actually fill in the content which help to [[Reduce friction]].
