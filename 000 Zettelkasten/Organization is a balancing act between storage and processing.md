# Organization is a balancing act between storage and processing

Good organization strikes a balance between allowing access to enough information and keeping enough out so that the access is quick and effortless.

It is a balance between having enough essence and enough space.

It should allow for access to enough so that progress is not hindered by the lack of some necessity but should keep needless things out in order to prevent them from halting the flow.
