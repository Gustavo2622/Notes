# Tools are a means to execute actions

Every tool we use is a means of executing a specific *action*, meaning taking getting some information about something or effecting some change on something *review definition of action and nomenclature*.

The action is more fundamental and more important than the tool. True mastery comes from knowing the actions we want to take and molding our tools and their use in order to fit the actions that the task requires.

The actions are how we interact with our [[Mental Models|Mental Model]] of the situation and should reflect it. Thus, actions are the native language of whatever models we might have and mastery over them is crucial in achieving fluency with the models.

## Examples

- When working with complex numbers and using the plane geometric mental model, we might want to rotate a given number (vector) through a specific angle. For this we can use the *tool* given by complex multiplication with a number given by Euler's formula. More concretely, wanting to rotate a number $z \in \mathbb{C}$ by $90$ degrees we can compute $z*i = -Im(z) + i*Re(z)$. We could also use a different tool to achieve the same action, namely matrices: 
$$\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} Re(z) \\ Im(z) \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix} -Im(z) \\ Re(z) \end{bmatrix}$$
