# Penultimate Step as a Problem Solving Tool

When trying to solve a hard problem, it is often easier to start from the conclusion and reason backwards towards the premises. 

The intuition behind this is that problem solving and thinking generally begins with a very broad knowledge base and tries to aim for a specific conclusion, therefore trying to hit a narrow target from a wide beginning. Switching the situation around, it is obviously easier to hit a broad target from a narrow beginning.

This intuition suggests that this approach is most useful in complicated scenarios, and the usefulness increases with the number of constraints in the conclusion as well as the amount of prior knowledge one has.

It also suggests a [[Hybrid Strategy]] of reasoning around the conclusion in order to increase its surface area and then alternating between forward of backwards reasoning until one gets to what one wants.

This is in analogy with [[Multi-Source Search]] and [[Logical Deduction]] and [[Interactive Proofs]], which support both [[Forward Reasoning]] and [[Backward Reasoning]].
