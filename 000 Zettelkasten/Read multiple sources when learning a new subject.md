# Read multiple sources when learning a new subject

When learning a new subject (such as a new field of math), it is often better to have multiple different sources (of around the same level or not) in order to better learn the material.

The multitude of approaches will help view the subject from different angles and establish a more complete picture. It will also help avoid some roadblock caused by single source studying.

This is in analogy to [[More Connections = Better Memory]], or rather, it is the application of that principle to the bibliography of a subject one is learning/wants to learn.
## How to implement

Have one or two primary sources which are studied in detail and some more secondary sources which are skimmed for certain parts of the material being studied in order to get different perspectives.
