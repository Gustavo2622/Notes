# Varying Challenge Enhances Learning

When learning something, it is often useful to make up little varied challenges around the thing you want to learn, so as to approach the difficulty from various angles. 

The novelty of each different challenge will also improve focus and retention, and the variety of different connections ([[More Connections = Better Memory]]) made in this process will aid memory formation and learning, and will cement the skill further and better than simply practicing the same thing over and over. 

Also, practicing a skill or using a concept in different contexts helps to solidify it into something which can be used as needed, rather than something which only applies in the specific situation in which it was learned ([[Mental Models become Mental Tools]]).

The novelty of the different challenges will also help with seeing new connections in what is being approached, and help think about it more intently. Coming up with the challenges themselves is often a form of [[Active Learning]] and can help with increasing engagement with the object of study ([[Maximize Engagement with what you are Learning]]).
