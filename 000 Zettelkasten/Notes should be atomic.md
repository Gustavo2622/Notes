# Notes should be atomic

Each note should be about one single thing, but be mostly self contained.

The possibility for the scope of what a note encompasses is a continuum and there is a trade-off when going in either direction.

The sweet spot is when a note is singular enough to not be easily separable but self contained enough so that it can be understood (to a sufficient degree, with the necessary background) in isolation (of the original context, so that new connections may form easily).
